kora revolves around hachibe maeda and his endless attempts to glorify his favourite parts. it is a creative attempt on the world of fetishes and takes the notion of \"objectifying women\" to another

torments the main female. however, the manga treats it in such a way that those things are acceptable as long as the person responsible has a reason. this \"romance\" story left a bad taste in my

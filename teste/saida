Kai Eto may look like a squeaky clean kid, but the Greater Kanto Narcotics Control Division's new investigator hides a violent alter ego and a dangerous past. With his stoic partner Hal Kurabayashi, Kai is assigned to track down and stop the distribution of Dragon Speed, a dangerous new drug.

While struggling against drug dealers, gangs, murderers, psychopaths, mysterious organizations and mad people in general, they have also to deal with their own mysteries, specially Kai.

What's behind this? Who is he, in fact?

In 2015 a fire at the main CC Corp. building resulted in the loss of a lot of data, and The World was forced to shut down. By splicing in data from what would have been another game, CC Corp was able to rebuild the game system. The next year, "The World R:2" was released, but many old players objected because they were unable to bring over their old characters. However, many new users were drawn in by the new style, and over 12 million copies were sold. Though not a match for the previous version's 20 million users, it became the top-selling netgame on the market." As a result of the new world, four major clans (Kestrel, Lunar Tree, Canard, and Raven) came to power.
